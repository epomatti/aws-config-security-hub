# AWS Security Hub + AWS Config

Using AWS Config rules and getting insights with AWS Security Hub.

## Setup

Set the SNS email receiver in a `.auto.tfvars` file:

```terraform
# Enable your email after apply (check your spam)
sns_email_destination = "joe@example.com"
```

Create the resources:

```sh
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## Architecture

Services and integrations implemented.

**üëâ Enable Security Hub manually using the Console.**

The ode provides a custom rule with Lambda to detect and remediate changes to CloudTrail (or other resources):

## AWS Config

After a short time, Config will display the findings:

Make changes to a resource such as the EC2 instance, and check the timeline:

Global recording is enabled ([ref1][1], [ref2][2]):

> Now, you can record changes to the configuration of your IAM Users, Groups, and Roles, including inline policies associated with them. You can also record attachments of your managed (customer-managed) policies and changes made to them.

As well as with other resources, it is possible to track the resource timeline:

## Security Hub

If you enabled Security Hub, it will sync up with AWS Config data.

Check the security posture:
