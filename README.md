Create the resources:

```sh
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

üëâ Using the Console, enable Security Hub manually.

Give it some time for scanning and check AWS Config:

> Now, you can record changes to the configuration of your IAM Users, Groups, and Roles, including inline policies associated with them. You can also record attachments of your managed (customer-managed) policies and changes made to them.

As well as with other resources, it is possible to track the resource timeline::
